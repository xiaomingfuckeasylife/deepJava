## Concurrency

####  A brief history of concurrency
  once before we had operation system , we can only execute one program each time which will access the hole resource of a mathine . nowadays , operation system can execute multiple program individually at the sametime using a thing called process . a process is an isolated , independent environment which is allocated by the system. process can comunicated with each other through `sockets` , `shared memory`,`semaphores`,`files`. 
  several motivations factors led to the development of operation system that execute task simultaneously . 
  * Resource utilization : sometimes a program will wait for some extra input or output , in these time , nothing valuable thing has been done . we can put other program to run at this time . 
  * Fairness : there are more than one user using the mathine then it is only fair that they using the resource by time slicing .
  * convinience : it is much more desirable to write multiple program and each program executed one task than one program perform all the task .
